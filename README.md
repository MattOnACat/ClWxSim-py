# Climate Weather Sim
A very simplistic weather simulator.

## Current Features
- Wind Simulation
- Pressure Advection and Diffusion

## Future Features
- Coriolis Effect
- Temperature Calculation, using ideal gas laws and the Pressure Simulation
- Humidity Simulation, including Precipitation and Cloud tracking
- UI with front tracking and views for humidity, temperatures, pressure, wind etc
- Ability to input any Planet map into the simulation
- Simulation state storage and continuation
